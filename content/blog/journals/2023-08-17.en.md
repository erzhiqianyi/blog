I have decided to start recording my day from today. Why? 
I've decided to use it as practice for my English.

This morning, I woke up around five-thirty, then ran eight kilometers. It took an hour. I felt a little tired, but I saw the kitten from yesterday again. It's adorable. It called out to me again today and looked like it's hungry. However, I didn't give it any food.

I left at seven-thirty, and after getting off the bus, there was a light drizzle.

For breakfast, I had a McDonald's hamburger. I bought a breakfast monthly card. The card cost eleven yuan, and the hamburger had a discount of ten yuan, saving me one yuan.

After that, it's work. It starts at nine in the morning and goes until half-past six. There were two English meetings. One meeting was for thirty minutes, and the other one was for an hour.

I had a hearty lunch. I went to a self-choice fast food place, so I could choose from many dishes. I selected a bit from each dish.

After work, I felt a bit tired. I took the bus back home. On the way, I watched some short Japanese videos on Instagram. I didn't want to use my brain too much, so I watched short videos. I should stop watching them.

With the help of ChatGPT, I wrote this diary. It took about 1 hour.
